## Android `BambooStorage` 
######Modern, fast and memory efficient Storage API based on `ContentProviders`

**BambooStorage** provides you a way to store your classes in `ContentProvider` without boilerplate `CRUD` (Create-Read-Update-Delete) code for each storable type

**PLEASE DO NOT STOP THINKING ABOUT THE LIBRARY AFTER YOU SAW the word "ContentProvider" :)**

If you currently use `SQLiteOpenHelper` (`SQLiteDatabase` under it) to store your data, you can easily switch to `BambooStorage` because it provides base class for `ContentProvider` with `SQLiteOpenHelper`
